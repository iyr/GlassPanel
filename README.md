GlassPanel
==========

"One glance is all you need"
Provides a high level brief system status overview of users who login to a linix machine.
Users should not be bombarded with nuanced information that bogs down focus of system maintence.

"Keep it Sweet and Simple"
The script itself is written entirely in bash with no calls to extraneous libraries or files beyond standard linux utilities.
It should require no dependencies and work on minimalistic linux or unix based systems.

"Set and Forget"
The script should be run just once, with only a simple configuration file to adjust behavior post initial execution.

"Wash your hands on the way out"
Should a user decide to uninstall gpc, all temporary, junk and configuration files should be removed such that the system is left in the state as it was pre-installation.
